# ðŸ’¡ Brainstorming Mode
Initialize and analyze new feature ideas before transitioning to Planning, leveraging advanced MCP tools for comprehensive ideation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Activation
- Automatically by `master-orchestrator` when detecting feature requests without Blueprint/Tasks
- Manually: user types "start brainstorming" or "@brainstorm"

## ðŸ§° Enhanced MCP Tools Integration

### Required Tools for This Mode:
1. **Sequential Thinking** - For structured ideation process
2. **Web Search** - For market research and trend analysis  
3. **Context7 MCP** - For technology and library exploration
4. **Interactive MCP** - For real-time stakeholder validation

## ðŸ“‹ Objectives
1. Collect raw ideas/requirements from user using **Interactive MCP**
2. Research market trends and best practices via **Web Search**
3. Explore available technologies and libraries through **Context7**
4. Use **Sequential Thinking** for systematic analysis (MoSCoW/Kano/Value vs Effort)
5. Generate **Idea Backlog** (`docs/ideas/idea-backlog.md`)
6. For selected ideas â†’ generate Blueprint framework (`templates/blueprint-template.yaml`)
7. Preliminary estimation (story points + complexity) & Risk/Benefit analysis
8. Conclude: transition to **Planning Mode** for detailed blueprint and task creation

## ðŸ›  Enhanced Workflow with MCP Tools

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery
1. **Initial Requirements Gathering** (Interactive MCP)
   - Ask guided questions (Who, What, Why, Success Criteria)
   - Use Interactive MCP for real-time clarification without breaking flow
   - Record in `## Raw Notes` section of Idea Backlog

2. **Market Research** (Web Search + Sequential Thinking)
   - Use Sequential Thinking to structure research approach
   - Use Web Search to find:
     - Current market trends in the domain
     - Competitor analysis and feature gaps
     - Industry best practices and standards
     - Recent technological developments

3. **Technology Exploration** (Context7 MCP)
   - Research relevant libraries and frameworks
   - Explore API capabilities and limitations
   - Identify technology dependencies and requirements

### Phase 2: Analysis & Prioritization
4. **Systematic Analysis** (Sequential Thinking)
   - Use Sequential Thinking for comprehensive evaluation:
     - MoSCoW prioritization (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
     - Kano model analysis (Basic, Performance, Excitement features)
     - Value vs Effort matrix
     - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

5. **Stakeholder Validation** (Interactive MCP)
   - Present findings and get real-time feedback
   - Validate assumptions and priorities
   - Refine ideas based on stakeholder input

### Phase 3: Documentation & Transition
6. **Generate Blueprint Draft**
   - For `must` or `should` ideas, create `<Feature>.blueprint.yaml` (Gate 0)
   - Set `gate_status: 0` with TODO items in all sections
   - Include research findings and technology choices

7. **Comprehensive Analysis Table**
   | Idea | Effort (SP) | Value | Complexity | Risk | Tech Stack | Market Trend |
   |------|-------------|-------|------------|------|------------|--------------|

8. **Output Summary**
   - Present prioritized idea table with research insights
   - Highlight top-N recommendations for Planning transition
   - Include implementation roadmap and next steps

## ðŸ“‘ Enhanced Idea Backlog Template
```md
# ðŸ“’ Idea Backlog

## Raw Notes
- [Date] User requirement: ...
- [Date] Clarification via Interactive MCP: ...

## Market Research Findings
### Technology Trends (Web Search)
- Current market direction: ...
- Competitor analysis: ...
- Industry standards: ...

### Technology Options (Context7)
- Available libraries: ...
- Framework considerations: ...
- API capabilities: ...

## Systematic Analysis (Sequential Thinking)
### MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must have**: Critical features for MVP
- **Should have**: Important but not critical
- **Could have**: Nice to have features
- **Won't have**: Out of scope for now

### Comprehensive Evaluation
| Idea | Effort (SP) | Value | Complexity | Risk | Tech Stack | Market Validation |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|------|------------|-------------------|
| Feature A | 8 | High | Medium | Low | React, Node.js | Strong demand |
| Feature B | 5 | Medium | Low | Medium | Python, FastAPI | Emerging trend |

## Stakeholder Validation
- [Interactive MCP] Feedback on priorities: ...
- [Interactive MCP] Risk concerns: ...
- [Interactive MCP] Timeline constraints: ...

## Approved Ideas for Planning
- [Feature Name]: Ready for blueprint creation
```

## ðŸ”„ Transition Strategy
- When user selects **Approve Ideas** â†’ Orchestrator sets `brainstorm_requested = false`, switch to `CURRENT_MODE = Planning`
- Include MCP research findings in blueprint creation
- Transfer technology choices and risk analysis to planning phase

## ðŸš¨ Enhanced Guardrails
- No code generation during brainstorming
- No writes to `src/` directory
- Only create/modify files in `docs/` (especially `docs/ideas/`) or `docs/blueprints/`
- **MCP Tool Usage Rules**:
  - Use Web Search responsibly (avoid excessive API calls)
  - Context7 queries should be focused and relevant
  - Interactive MCP should not interrupt user flow unnecessarily
  - Sequential Thinking should be proportional to problem complexity
