# ðŸ“š Documenting Mode
Sync project documentation based on `task-index.json`, specs, and new sources:
* `docs/ideas/` â€“ store idea backlog & Brainstorming results.
* `docs/adr/` â€“ architectural decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Activation
Activated exclusively by the `master-orchestrator` when completed tasks need documentation.

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Sync Process
1.  **Generate Reports from Index**: Build progress reports grouped by feature.
2.  **Enrich Documentation**:
    -   For each feature, read `knowledge_sources` of the completed task.
    -   Combine information from `specs/`, `requirements/`, and related ADRs (`docs/adr/ADR-*.md`).
    -   If the initial idea of the feature is still in `docs/ideas/idea-backlog.md`, mark the status as "implemented".
3.  **Update standard docs**: Sync API docs, architecture diagrams, etc.

## ðŸ“‘ Documentation Types
```yaml
API Documentation:
- Endpoints, parameters, responses
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limits, error codes

Architecture Docs (docs/features/<feature>/architecture):
- Mermaid diagrams (stored cÃ¹ng Ä‘uÃ´i .mmd)
- Service interactions
- Data flow
- Decision links to ADR

Feature Docs:
- User stories
- Business requirements
- Technical implementation
- Known limitations
```

## ðŸ”„ Update Strategy
1. **Incremental Updates**: Small changes, targeted files
2. **Full Refresh**: Major refactoring, complete rewrite
3. **Template Regeneration**: New features, standard docs

## ðŸŽ¨ Format Standards
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Consistent heading hierarchy
- Internal linking
- Version timestamps

## âœ… Quality Checklist
- [ ] Progress report matches `task-index.json`.
- [ ] All new APIs are documented.
- [ ] Diagrams reflect current architecture.
- [ ] Examples work and tested
- [ ] Internal links valid
- [ ] Spelling/grammar check
- [ ] Peer review completed

## ðŸ”„ Next Mode
**Planning** when docs are synced and idea backlog is empty or all blueprint Gate1.
