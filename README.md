   npm run convert-to-cursor-rules
   ```

3. **Validate conversion**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate-cursor-rules
   ```

4. **Test in Cursor IDE**:
   - Open project in Cursor
   - Check Settings > Rules for loaded rules
   - Test agent modes in chat interface

5. **Fine-tune as needed**:
   - Adjust rule descriptions for better AI decisions
   - Modify glob patterns for more precise targeting
   - Customize agent prompts for your workflow

## 🧰 Advanced Usage

### Rule Creation Best Practices
- **Always Rules**: Limit to 3-5 core rules for performance
- **Agent Rules**: Provide comprehensive descriptions for AI decision-making
- **Auto Rules**: Use specific glob patterns to avoid false triggers
- **Manual Rules**: Keep for reference materials and templates

### Performance Optimization
- Use `.cursorindexignore` to exclude large data files
